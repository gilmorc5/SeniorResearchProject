Research on CUPS Printer

**What is CUPS: **

Apart from something to drink off CUPS in Linux is: Common Unix Printing System

CUPS is responsible in general for making you connect a printer to Ubuntu and not needing to install any drivers. You can say that CUPS is the one responsible for making almost all printers into a Out of the Box experience. No need for additional drivers, Printer CDs/DVDs or in most cases having to compile and do a lot of work to have it working instantly.

The other acronym that stands out as CUPS is HPLIP which is HP Linux Imaging and Printing. This one gives some enhancements over HP printers and all-in-one. If you are the 1% that has problems with detecting your HP printer with CUPS then try HPLIP. It covers that extra 1%. And it shows stuff like ink level and some other specific HP variables.

**How to connect to a Network Printer**

Assuming you are using the default Ubuntu which comes with CUPS go to the Cog symbol in the top right part of the screen (Looks like a Gear). Click on it and select System Settings. Then click on Printers. Now click on the Add button to add the printer.

Note that since the printer is on the network (Not connected to you directly) the option for Network Printer will appear empty for a couple of seconds. The time depends on the network, how the router handles the queue and any other devices connected on the network. After a while the printer should appear under the Network Printer section and you will be able to select it. CUPS will take care of either installing the drivers if available or downloading one if not found on the system (Eg: Epson L555). In some cases for me it took 45 seconds, in others 5 seconds.

In this case, the computer that is sharing the printer should make sure that the printer configuration is correctly configured as mentioned above. If the Printer has wireless access, then make sure the printer is correctly connected to the router and that your PC is also correctly connected to the same wireless router. In the case you are connected via wired cable and the printer via wireless to the same router or same network, you need to also configure the router to make sure all wireless devices see wired ones.

How to configure the Printer section in Samba
Verify you have the printer connected and samba/cups installed (The samba and cups packages should be installed, if not simply install them). This is because CUPS handles the printer while Samba handles the sharing but just in case you don't have them simply:

sudo apt-get install cups samba
After that we start with the configuration of them. If you are on either the desktop or server version of Ubuntu you can quickly configure it with this terminal way (The GUI way is explained above):

Edit your samba main configuration which is located in /etc/samba/smb.conf. Type:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
We want to change the following variables and remove the comment (# or ;) symbols in front of them if they have it. So for example:

Change the WORKGROUP to the one the network is using, so other devices on the same workgroup will be able to see the printer:

workgroup = WORKGROUP_NAME
If you wish to allow guest to print then look for the ;GUEST = YES and remove the ; in front of it:

guest = yes
Now look for the security option and change it to share, this will save you several issues later on:

security = share
Now we go directly to ther samba printer section which would look something like this:

 [printers]
    comment = All Printers
    browseable = no
    path = /var/spool/samba
    printable = yes
;   guest ok = no
;   read only = yes
    create mask = 0700
what we want to do is change browseable to yes and guest ok to yes

Should look like this after editing:

 [printers]
    comment = All Printers
    browseable = yes
    path = /var/spool/samba
    printable = yes
    guest ok = yes
;   read only = yes
    create mask = 0700
This is all. Now restart the samba service. you can do it in several ways:

**sudo service smbd restart**

Now go to your windows system or Linux system and look for the printer in the network or the server IP. It might take some time because of how the network is configured and devices connected to it, but this should be the basic to configure any printer on the network.
